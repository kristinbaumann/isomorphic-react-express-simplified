# Simplified Isomorphic / Universal JavaScript Example
 - uses React, Express, Webpack and Babel
 - code divided in **shared**, **client** and **server**
 - no distracting extras - just the plain process of rendering an isomorphic web application
 - preserving the app state by handing it over from server to client

### Installation

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```
